What is tabulation?

Tabulation is a technique that is used to implement the DP algorithms. It is also known as a bottom-up approach. It starts from solving the lowest level sub-problem. The solution to the lowest level sub-problem will help to solve next level sub-problem, and so forth. We solve all the sub-problems iteratively until we solve all the sub-problems. This approach saves the time when a sub-problem needs a solution of the sub-problem that has been solved before.


What is Memoization?

Memoization is a technique that is used to implement the DP algorithms. Memoization is also known as a top-down approach. It starts from solving the highest-level sub-problems. Initially, it solves the highest-level subproblem and then solve the next sub-problem recursively and the next. Suppose there are two sub-problems, i.e., sub-problem A and sub-problem B. When sub-problem B is called recursively, then it can use the solution of sub-problem A, which has already been used. Since A and all the sub-problems are memoized, it avoids solving the entire recursion tree generated by B and saves computation time.


for fibonacci
----------------

  Tabulization -> starting from 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ..... n (using iteration)
  Meomoization -> starting from n -1 , n-2 , n-3 , n-4 ..... 1 , 0 (using recursive call)
